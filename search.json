    "text": "Want to work together?\n\nAre you are a researcher interested in collaborating with us?\n\nAs a result of my extensive biostatistics training and experience, I truly love collaborating with other researchers, especially students. Please note that our skills are not only applicable to “science” topics – we can help where data exists!\nPlease reach out if you think this may be a good fit! It is a wonderful experience to see how students begin connecting the dots, understanding their role as partners in scientific research.\nThe main expectations within collaborations include a reasonable timeline for project deliverables and formal co-authorship for both the lab director and collaborating student on any resulting presentation or manuscript.\n\n\n\nAre you a student interested in collaborative statistics?\n\nAs a collaborative researcher and educator, I especially enjoy including students in collaborative projects. My goal is to model how to form and maintain respectful and productive collaborative relationships.\nThis side of the lab gives students a formal collaborative experience resulting in a non-statistics or data science-focused research product to showcase to potential employers.\nThe main expectations of collaborative students are a willingness to collaborate outside of your field, learn necessary statistical and/or science concepts, and a willingness to learn and improve your R programming skills.\n\n\n\nAre you a student interested breaking the rules of statistics?\n\nAs a curious mathematician and statistician, I have a lot of “what happens to analysis results when this assumption is broken?” questions ready for students to answer via Proseminar or Capstone.\n\nIf you think about it - you probably do too! Let’s consider OLS regression. We know that OLS assumes that the residuals are normally distributed with mean 0 and some constant standard deviation.\nWhat happens if the residuals have a Poisson distribution? A uniform distribution?\nWhat happens if the standard deviation is not constant? How does this change depending on the level of heterogeneity?\nHow do the observed relationships above change as our sample size increases? (i.e., what are the asymptotic properties?)\n\nThe main expectations of simulation-based students are a willingness to learn necessary mathematical and/or statistical concepts, a willingness to learn and improve their R programming skills, and to have an inherent understanding that research-related things will go very wrong more than once."
