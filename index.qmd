The **Seals Lab for Quantitative Science** focuses on three areas:

1. The application of statistics to other sciences, such as environmental science, ecology, epidemiology, and medicine.
2. Simulation studies to determine what happens when statistical models are misspecified.
3. Topics in college- and graduate-level STEM education.
    
Note: If you are specifically interested in computational environmental science research (either applied statistics or methodological explorations in the context of earth and environmental science), please see the [Computational Geomorphology & Modeling Lab](http://cgmlabuwf.github.io).
