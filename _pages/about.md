The **Seals Lab for Quantitative Science** focuses on three areas:

1. The application of statistics to other sciences, such as environmental science, ecology, epidemiology, medicine, and public health.

    - If you are specifically interested in computational environmental science research (either applied statistics or methodological explorations in the context of earth and environmental science), please see the <a href="https://cgmlabuwf.github.io/">Computational Geomorphology & Modeling Lab</A>.
    
2. Simulation studies to determine what happens when statistical models are misspecified. 

3. Topics in statistics education: 

    a. The effects of interdisciplinary collaborative projects in the statistics classroom.
    b. The effects of including computational methods within STEM classrooms.
    c. The development of activities to engage online statistics learners.

**Upcoming Events**
