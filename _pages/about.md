The Seals Lab for Quantitative Science focuses on three areas:

1. The application of statistics to other sciences, such as environmental science, ecology, epidemiology, medicine, and public health.
2. Simulation studies to determine what happens when assumptions are broken in field-specific models. 
3. Topics in statistics education: 

    a. The effects of interdisciplinary collaborative projects in the statistics classroom.
    b. The effects of including computational methods within STEM classrooms.
    c. Interesting activities to engage online learners in the statistics classroom.
    
Note: If you are interested in computational environmental science research, please see the [Computational Geomorphology & Modeling Lab](https://cgmlabuwf.github.io/).
