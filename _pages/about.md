The <b>Seals Lab for Quantitative Science</b> focuses on three areas:

<ol>
  <li>The application of statistics to other sciences, such as environmental science, ecology, epidemiology, and medicine.</li>
  <li>Simulation studies to determine what happens when statistical models are misspecified.</li>
  <li>Topics in STEM education: </li>
  <ol>
  <li>The effects of interdisciplinary collaborative projects in the statistics classroom.</li>
  <li>The effects of including computational methods within STEM classrooms.</li>
  <li>The development of activities to engage online statistics learners.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

Note: If you are specifically interested in computational environmental science research (either applied statistics or methodological explorations in the context of earth and environmental science), please see the <a href="https://cgmlabuwf.github.io/">Computational Geomorphology & Modeling Lab</a>.
