**About Dr. Seals**

- I am a native of the [Florida Panhandle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_panhandle) and graduate of the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://uwf.edu/hmcse/departments/mathematics-and-statistics/) at the [University of West Florida](https://uwf.edu/). 
- After completing the BS in Mathematics (2006) and MS in Mathematical Sciences (2008), I joined the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/biostatistics) at the [University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://www.uab.edus) as a [NHLBI T32 pre-doctoral trainee](https://sites.uab.edu/bstepit32/).
- In July 2013, I completed the [PhD in Biostatistics](https://digitalcommons.library.uab.edu/etd-collection/2936/) under the supervision of [Dr. Chichi Aban](https://scholars.uab.edu/1922-inmaculada-aban). 
    - My dissertation was awarded the Charles R. Katholi Dissertation Award in Septemer 2013.
- After a postdoctoral position as a research biostatistician, I rejoined the UWF Department of Mathematics and Statistics as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the fall of 2016. I am now an Associate Professor with tenure.

**Research Areas**

<details>
<summary><i>Model misspecification in the frequentist framework.</i></summary> 
<ul>
  <li>How are our analysis results and overall message affected when we misspecify the design matrix, underlying distribution for the outcome, or the working covariance structure?</li>
  <li>How are analysis results and overall message affected when we break an assumption (or multiple assumptions) of the parametric model?</li>
  <li>This area generally involves performing simulation studies. We do this so that we know the true value of *&theta;*, the parameter of interest and can then quantify the effects of model misspecification. 
  <ul>
    <li>The bias and mean square error quantify the error in parameter estimation.</li> 
    <li>Type I error quantifies the error in statistical inference.</li>
    <li>Model fit indices quantify the error in model selection.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

</details>

<details>
<summary><i>Computational environmental science.</i></summary> 
<ul>
  <li>Please see the *[Computational Geomorphology & Modeling Lab](https://cgmlabuwf.github.io/)*.</li>
  <li>How can we use mathematics and statistics to answer questions about the natural environment around us?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>We are interested in modeling and predicting natural phenomena and changes within our local environment.</li>
  </ul>  
  <li>Because the University maintains an active research site on Pensacola Beach, we have natural opportunities for collaboration with the Department of Earth and Environmental Science.</ul>

</details>

<details>
<summary><i>Education: both general STEM and discipline-specific</i></summary> 

<ul>
  <li>What are the longitudinal effects of student-led interventions in gateway STEM courses?</li>
  <li>What instructional tools improve student outcomes in the statistics classroom?</li> 
  <li>How are student learning outcomes impacted when STEM courses naturally infuse statistics into the curriculum?</li>
  <li>When are significant learning gains made during statistics and data science graduate programs?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Is there a difference in when learning gains are made between those in statistics, biostatistics, and data science programs?</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

**Want to Work Together?**

<details>
<summary><i>Are you are a researcher interested in collaborating with us?</i></summary>

<ul>
  <li>As a result of my extensive biostatistics training and experience, I truly love collaborating with other researchers, especially students. Please note that our skills are not only applicable to "science" topics -- our skills are applicable to any field where data exists!</li>
  <li>Please reach out if you think this may be a good fit! It is a wonderful experience to see how students begin connecting the dots, understanding their role as partners in scientific research.</li>
  <li>The main expectations within collaborations include a reasonable timeline for project deliverables and formal co-authorship for both the lab director and collaborating student on any resulting presentation or manuscript.</li>
</ul>

</details>

<details>
<summary><i>Are you a student interested in collaborative statistics?</i></summary>

<ul>
  <li>As a collaborative researcher and educator, I especially enjoy including students in collaborative projects. My goal is to model how to form and maintain respectful and productive collaborative relationships.</li>
  <li>This side of the lab gives students a formal collaborative experience resulting in a non-statistics or data science-focused research product to showcase to potential employers. </li>
  <li>The main expectations of collaborative students are a willingness to collaborate outside of your field, learn necessary statistical and/or science concepts, and a willingness to learn and improve your R programming skills.</li>
</ul>
</details> 

<details>

<summary><i>Are you a student interested breaking the rules of statistics?</i></summary>

<ul>
  <li>As a curious mathematician and statistician, I have a lot of "what happens to analysis results when this assumption is broken?" questions ready for students to answer via Proseminar or Capstone.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If you think about it - you probably do too! Let's consider OLS regression. We know that OLS assumes that the residuals are normally distributed with mean 0 and some constant standard deviation.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>What happens if the residuals have a Poisson distribution? A uniform distribution?</li>
      <li>What happens if the standard deviation is not constant? How does this change depending on the level of heterogeneity?</li>
      <li>How do the observed relationships above change as our sample size increases? (i.e., what are the asymptotic properties?)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>The main expectations of simulation-based students are a willingness to learn necessary mathematical and/or statistical  concepts, a willingness to learn and improve their R programming skills, and to have an inherent understanding that research-related things will go very wrong more than once.</li>
</ul>
